SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The `M365FoundationsCISReport` module provides cmdlets for auditing and
    reporting on the security compliance of Microsoft 365 environments based on
    CIS benchmarks.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The `M365FoundationsCISReport` module is designed to help administrators
    ensure that their Microsoft 365 environments adhere to the security best
    practices outlined by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The module
    includes cmdlets for performing comprehensive security audits, generating
    detailed reports, and synchronizing audit results with CIS benchmark Excel
    sheets. It aims to streamline the process of maintaining security compliance
    and improving the overall security posture of Microsoft 365 environments.

Optional Subtopics
    AUDITING AND REPORTING
    The module provides cmdlets that allow for the auditing of various security
    aspects of Microsoft 365 environments, including user MFA status,
    administrative role licenses, and more. The results can be exported and
    analyzed to ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks.

    DATA SYNCHRONIZATION
    The module includes functionality to synchronize audit results with CIS
    benchmark data stored in Excel sheets. This ensures that the documentation
    is always up-to-date with the latest audit findings.

EXAMPLES
    # Example 1: Performing a security audit based on CIS benchmarks
    $auditResults = Invoke-M365SecurityAudit -TenantAdminUrl "https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com"
    $auditResults = Invoke-M365SecurityAudit -TenantAdminUrl "https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com" -DomainName "contoso.com" -ApprovedCloudStorageProviders "DropBox" -ApprovedFederatedDomains "northwind.com"
    
    # Example 2: Exporting a security audit and it's nested tables to zipped CSV files
    Export-M365SecurityAuditTable -AuditResults $auditResults -ExportPath "C:\temp" -ExportOriginalTests -ExportAllTests
        # Output Ex: 2024.07.07_14.55.55_M365FoundationsAudit_368B2E2F.zip
    
    # Example 3: Retrieving licenses for users in administrative roles
    Get-AdminRoleUserLicense
    
    # Example 4: Getting MFA status of users
    Get-MFAStatus -UserId "user@domain.com"
    
    # Example 5: Removing rows with empty status values from a CSV file
    Remove-RowsWithEmptyCSVStatus -FilePath "C:\Reports\Report.xlsx" -WorksheetName "Sheet1"
    
    # Example 6: Synchronizing CIS benchmark data with audit results
    Sync-CISExcelAndCsvData -ExcelPath "path\to\excel.xlsx" -CsvPath "path\to\data.csv" -SheetName "Combined Profiles"
    
    # Example 7: Granting Microsoft Graph permissions to the auditor
    Grant-M365SecurityAuditConsent -UserPrincipalNameForConsent 'user@example.com'

NOTE
    Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and administrative roles in
    your Microsoft 365 environment to run these cmdlets. Proper configuration
    and setup are required for accurate audit results.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    If you encounter any issues while using the cmdlets, ensure that your
    environment meets the module prerequisites. Check for any updates or patches
    that may address known bugs. For issues related to specific cmdlets, refer
    to the individual help files for troubleshooting tips.
