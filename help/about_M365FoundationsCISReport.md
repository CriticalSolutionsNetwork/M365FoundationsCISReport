## about_M365FoundationsCISReport

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
The `M365FoundationsCISReport` module provides cmdlets for auditing and reporting on the security compliance of Microsoft 365 environments based on CIS benchmarks.

# LONG DESCRIPTION
The `M365FoundationsCISReport` module is designed to help administrators ensure that their Microsoft 365 environments adhere to the security best practices outlined by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The module includes cmdlets for performing comprehensive security audits, generating detailed reports, and synchronizing audit results with CIS benchmark Excel sheets. It aims to streamline the process of maintaining security compliance and improving the overall security posture of Microsoft 365 environments.

## Optional Subtopics
### Auditing and Reporting
The module provides cmdlets that allow for the auditing of various security aspects of Microsoft 365 environments, including user MFA status, administrative role licenses, and more. The results can be exported and analyzed to ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks.

### Data Synchronization
The module includes functionality to synchronize audit results with CIS benchmark data stored in Excel sheets. This ensures that the documentation is always up-to-date with the latest audit findings.

# EXAMPLES
```powershell
# Example 1: Exporting a security audit table to a CSV file
Export-M365SecurityAuditTable -OutputPath "C:\AuditReports\SecurityAudit.csv"

# Example 2: Retrieving licenses for users in administrative roles
Get-AdminRoleUserLicense -RoleName "Global Administrator"

# Example 3: Getting MFA status of users
Get-MFAStatus -UserPrincipalName "user@domain.com"

# Example 4: Performing a security audit based on CIS benchmarks
Invoke-M365SecurityAudit -OutputPath "C:\AuditReports\AuditResults.xlsx"

# Example 5: Removing rows with empty status values from a CSV file
Remove-RowsWithEmptyCSVStatus -InputPath "C:\AuditReports\AuditResults.csv" -OutputPath "C:\AuditReports\CleanedResults.csv"

# Example 6: Synchronizing CIS benchmark data with audit results
Sync-CISExcelAndCsvData -ExcelPath "C:\CISBenchmarks\CISBenchmark.xlsx" -CsvPath "C:\AuditReports\AuditResults.csv"
```

# NOTE
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and administrative roles in your Microsoft 365 environment to run these cmdlets. Proper configuration and setup are required for accurate audit results.

# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
If you encounter any issues while using the cmdlets, ensure that your environment meets the module prerequisites. Check for any updates or patches that may address known bugs. For issues related to specific cmdlets, refer to the individual help files for troubleshooting tips.
